# Neotopia_Railways_Navigator
 Fake ticketing application, which I developed to teach myself backend development and some UX Design principles.


## Todos:

### Backend:
- Error handling: Catch error on signup and log out message
- Expand database.js and api to the growing database

### Frontend:
- Start with Login page for user authentication and save users in db
- Why is an error returned when creating new user?

### Database:
- Plan further tables
- Start with implementing a table for a test-train


### Backlog:
- Learn about SSL encryption, so data can be safely transferred through http requests
